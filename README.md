# Time_Series_Forecasting

The Air Pollution in Beijing dataset focuses on environmental factors contributing to air quality, specifically PM2.5 concentrations, which are a major indicator of air pollution. The dataset includes various weather features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, alongside the PM2.5 values, to help predict pollution levels over time.

The analysis aims to optimize prediction models for PM2.5 concentrations, utilizing deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to capture the temporal dependencies in the data. By exploring different model architectures, activation functions, optimizers, and hyperparameters, the goal is to minimize errors, improve prediction accuracy, and understand the underlying factors influencing air pollution in Beijing.

Key findings reveal that while LSTM models can capture temporal patterns, further optimization and exploration of additional features and model complexities (such as Bidirectional LSTMs or attention mechanisms) are needed for improved prediction performance.
